### Captains Log 1
*We, The council of MetaUsers welcome you Earthling,  
You finally managed to breach through the congested gasses of earth and reached our planet Open Sourcia. We are not an hostile planet, but we have certain rules. First of all we want you to trow out all habit loops you learned as an earthling, here you are nothing yet except a user. A fragile user in vast net of interconnected souls. We live and die through collaboration and want to make a MetaUser as well out of you. Time is irrelavent here, sharing what you learn is the key. I urge you to have a look at our library, our central nerve system that is the start and the end of every loop*
