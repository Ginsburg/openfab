Hello, welcome on Board! We are glad to see you there :)

## What we do at OpenFab?
- [Context:](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/wiki/Context) First things first, we need to observe our environment, what's around us but also discover who we are, what defines us (mutual values, commun interests). All this define in which context we are and then helps us determine what we want to do.
- [Objective:](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/wiki/Objective) Now that we know in which context we evolve, we can decide what to do, what is our objective.
- [Proposition:]() Based on our different individual experiences, on our commun interests, we developped our own methodology to manage OpenFab but also every project we have. It's inspired from gamification, permaculture, design thinking, opensource, etc. It's based on 3 major values which are:

_Iteration.  
_Empowerment.

## Need Help? 
- Google is your friend, try by yourself. Finally, if you are still stuck, start an issue and ask around (to know how to do so, read "[Contributing](https://github.com/openfab-lab/openfab/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)"). You can also join our [Facebook Group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/openfablab.brussels/) if you are more familiar with it. But most of what we do takes place on Github so we strongly advice you to try here.
